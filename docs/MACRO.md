# Macro Module (`property_adviser.macro`)

The **macro** module provides Australian macroeconomic data for use in property models.  
It downloads, parses, and annualises official sources, and writes tidy CSVs for downstream use.

## Integration

To join macro data into your derived property dataset:

```python
from property_adviser.macro.macro_data import add_macro_yearly

df = ...  # your property-level dataset with a 'saleYear' column
df_with_macro = add_macro_yearly(df, macro_path="data/macro/macro_au_annual.csv")
```

This merges on `saleYear` ‚Üí `year` and attaches CPI, ASX, and Cash Rate features.

```

Do you want me to also add a **‚Äúcurrent coverage‚Äù table** (min year ‚Üí max year) from your latest run, so you can see at a glance that CPI/ASX/Cash go up to 2025?
```
