# Property Analyst - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Property Analyst application has been successfully updated to implement your new 4-phase logic structure. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Phase Structure Implemented

### 1. Preprocessing
- Purpose: Clean, standardize and derive additional data for modeling
- Status: ✅ Completed with app page (app/pages/1_Data_Preprocessing.py)

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Purpose: Understand features and automatically select features for prediction
- Status: ✅ Completed with enhanced app page (app/pages/2_Feature_Engineering.py)

### 3. Model Selection
- Purpose: Find the best model, given yearmonth, bed, bath, car, propertyType and street, predict the given yearmonth's salePrice
- Approach: Timeseries model leveraging historical data
- Status: ✅ Completed with new app page (app/pages/3_Model_Selection.py)

### 4. Model Prediction
- Purpose: Predict based on selected model
- Status: ✅ Completed with new app page (app/pages/4_Model_Prediction.py)

## Code Changes Made

### src/model_training.py
- Enhanced with timeseries-focused approach for property price prediction
- Updated `train_models()` to use the new timeseries approach by default
- Maintains compatibility with existing pipeline
- Fixed parameter validation issues with LinearRegression model

### src/model_prediction.py (NEW MODULE)
- Created new module specifically for prediction functionality
- Implemented `predict_property_price()` for single property predictions
- Implemented `predict_property_prices_batch()` for multiple property predictions
- Added `predict_with_confidence_interval()` for uncertainty quantification
- Includes proper error handling and model loading functionality

### app/pages/3_Model_Selection.py (NEW PAGE)
- Interactive Streamlit page for model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Compare different models (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- Configure hyperparameters with visual interface
- Training data preview with X,y datasets samples
- Real-time performance metrics visualization
- Fixed LinearRegression parameter validation issues

### app/pages/4_Model_Prediction.py (NEW PAGE)
- Interactive Streamlit page for making predictions
- Single property prediction interface with all required features
- Batch prediction capability via CSV upload
- Confidence intervals for predictions
- Model information display

### Configuration Files
- Consolidated feature_engineering.yml and features.yml into a single comprehensive features.yml file
- Updated model.yml with proper hyperparameter grids for each model type
- Fixed LinearRegression configuration to have empty grid to avoid invalid parameter errors
- Updated all references in the codebase to use the consolidated configurations

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Timeseries Forecasting**: Model specifically designed to predict property prices based on yearmonth, bed, bath, car, propertyType, and street
2. **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Comprehensive categorical analysis using ANOVA and Cramér's V
3. **Model Selection Interface**: Visual comparison of different algorithms with hyperparameter tuning
4. **Prediction Interface**: User-friendly interface for both single and batch predictions
5. **Confidence Intervals**: Predictions include uncertainty estimates
6. **CSV Batch Processing**: Upload multiple properties for prediction at once
7. **Training Data Verification**: Preview datasets used for model training

## Files Created/Modified

- ✅ src/model_training.py (enhanced with timeseries focus and bug fixes)
- ✅ src/model_prediction.py (new)
- ✅ app/pages/3_Model_Selection.py (new) 
- ✅ app/pages/4_Model_Prediction.py (new)
- ✅ Updated configuration files (model.yml, features.yml)
- ✅ Documentation files (QWEN.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

## How to Use

1. Run the full pipeline: `python -m src.run_pipeline`
2. Access the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app/app.py`
3. Navigate through the pages in order:
   - "1 Data Preprocessing" for data preparation
   - "2 Feature Engineering" for feature analysis and selection
   - "3 Model Selection" for training and comparing models
   - "4 Model Prediction" for making price predictions

All four phases of your updated logic are now fully implemented and integrated into the application.
