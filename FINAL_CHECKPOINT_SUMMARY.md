- Understand features and automatically select features for prediction
- Status: Fully implemented with enhanced app page (pages/2_Feature_Engineering.py)

### ✅ Phase 3: Model Selection (Model Selection)
- Find the best model for predicting property prices based on key features
- Status: Fully implemented with new app page (pages/3_Model_Selection.py)

### ✅ Phase 4: Model Prediction (Model Prediction)
- Predict property prices using selected model
- Status: Fully implemented with new app page (pages/4_Model_Prediction.py)

## Key Features Implemented

### Enhanced Feature Engineering
1. **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**:
   - Numeric features: Pearson correlation analysis
   - Categorical-Numeric: ANOVA with effect size (eta squared) measurement
   - Categorical-Categorical: Cramér's V association analysis with threshold filtering

2. **Intelligent Feature Recommendations**:
   - Automatic calculation of feature importance scores
   - "Auto Select Features" button for intelligent feature selection
   - "Use All Features" functionality for quick selection

3. **Training Dataset Generation**:
   - One-click X,y dataset creation with selected features
   - Dataset preview with shape and sample data
   - Proper preservation of baseline columns (saleYear, saleMonth, suburb)

### Model Selection
1. **Multi-Model Comparison**:
   - LinearRegression (no hyperparameters - minimal tuning)
   - RandomForestRegressor (tree-based parameters)
   - GradientBoostingRegressor (boosting parameters)
   - Lasso (regularization parameter)
   - ElasticNet (regularization parameters)

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Customizable parameter grids for each model type
   - Visual interface for parameter configuration
   - Proper validation to avoid model-specific parameter errors

3. **Training Data Verification**:
   - Preview of X,y datasets used for training
   - Model configuration display

### Model Prediction
1. **Flexible Prediction Options**:
   - Single property prediction interface
   - Batch prediction via CSV upload
   - Confidence intervals for uncertainty quantification

2. **Model Integration**:
   - Seamless connection with best performing model from selection phase
   - Model information display
   - Error handling and user feedback

## Files Structure

## How to Use

1. **Full Pipeline Execution**:
   ```
   python -m src.run_pipeline
   ```

2. **Interactive App**:
   ```
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

3. **Navigation Flow**:
   - Page 1: Data Preprocessing (clean and prepare data)
   - Page 2: Feature Engineering (analyze and select features)
   - Page 3: Model Selection (train and compare models)
   - Page 4: Model Prediction (make price predictions)

## Recent Fixes Applied

1. **LinearRegression Parameter Validation**:
   - Fixed model.yml to ensure LinearRegression has empty grid `{}`
   - Updated Streamlit page logic to always ensure LinearRegression gets empty grid
   - Added proper error handling with full traceback information

2. **Model Configuration Consistency**:
   - Removed invalid parameters from model grids (alpha, l1_ratio from tree-based models)
   - Ensured each model type has appropriate hyperparameters
   - Fixed YAML structure issues with proper indentation and format

3. **Streamlit Page Integrity**:
   - Recreated corrupted Model Selection page with fresh implementation
   - Restored "Train Models" button functionality
   - Fixed syntax issues caused by escape sequences during editing

All components are fully functional and integrated. The application provides a complete end-to-end pipeline for property price forecasting.
