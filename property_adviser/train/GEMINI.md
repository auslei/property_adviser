## Train Module Agent Guide

This guide provides instructions for interacting with the Gemini agent within the `property_adviser/train` module.

### Purpose & Scope
The `train` module is responsible for training, evaluating, and persisting the prediction model.

### Gemini's Role
- **Model Training:** Assist in implementing and tuning the model training process.
- **Model Evaluation:** Help in evaluating the model performance using different metrics.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Track experiments and their results.

### Interaction Guidelines
- **Configuration:** Use the `config/model.yml` file to configure the training process.
- **Model Selection:** Specify the model to be trained and the hyperparameters to be used.
- **Output Artifacts:** Be aware of the output artifacts generated by the training process, such as the trained model and the evaluation metrics.
