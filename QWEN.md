# Property Analyst Development Notes

## Overview
This document captures the development notes and progress for the Property Analyst application - an end-to-end pipeline for forecasting next-year property sale prices from suburb-level CSVs.

## Current Project Structure

The project is organized into 4 main phases:

### 1. Preprocessing
- Purpose: Clean, standardize and derive additional data for modeling
- Status: ✅ Completed with corresponding app page (Data Preprocessing)

### 2. Feature Engineering  
- Purpose: Understand features and automatically select features for prediction
- Status: ✅ Completed with corresponding app page (Feature Engineering)

### 3. Model Selection
- Purpose: Find the best model, given yearmonth, bed, bath, car, propertyType and street, predict the given yearmonth's salePrice
- Approach: Timeseries model leveraging historical data
- Status: ✅ Completed with corresponding app page (Model Selection)

### 4. Model Prediction
- Purpose: Predict based on selected model
- Status: ✅ Completed with corresponding app page (Model Prediction)

## Development Progress
- ✅ Preprocessing: Implemented and tested
- ✅ Feature Engineering: Implemented and tested
- ✅ Model Selection: Implemented and tested

- Removed redundant configuration sections for cleaner UI

### Model Selection Implementation
- Created new Streamlit page for model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Implemented comprehensive model comparison (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- Added proper hyperparameter grid configurations for each model type
- Fixed LinearRegression parameter validation issues by ensuring empty grid configuration

### Suburb Median Simplification
- Eliminated unnecessary machine learning forecasting model for median prediction
- Simplified approach uses only observed historical medians with global fallback
- Removed complex dependencies (scikit-learn ML components)
- Improved maintainability and reduced code complexity
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing interfaces

## Key Features Implemented

### Feature Engineering
1. **Comprehensive Feature Analysis**: Both numeric and categorical feature correlations/associations
2. **Automatic Recommendations**: Statistical-based feature selection with scoring
3. **Categorical Analysis**: ANOVA for numeric-categorical and Cramér's V for categorical-categorical associations
4. **Training Dataset Generation**: One-click creation of X,y datasets with selected features

### Model Selection
1. **Multi-Model Comparison**: Compare performance of 5 different regression algorithms
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Customizable parameter grids for each model type
3. **Performance Metrics**: R², MAE, RMSE comparisons with visual highlighting
4. **Training Data Verification**: Sample preview of datasets being used for training

### Model Prediction
1. **Single Property Prediction**: Easy-to-use interface for predicting individual property prices
2. **Batch Prediction**: CSV upload for multiple property predictions at once
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Uncertainty quantification for all predictions
4. **Model Information**: Display of best performing model and its hyperparameters

### Suburb Median Simplification
1. **Simplified Median Computation**: Uses only observed historical data instead of ML forecasting
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated 150+ lines of unnecessary ML code and dependencies
3. **Improved Reliability**: Deterministic results based on actual data rather than ML predictions
4. **Better Performance**: Faster execution without ML model overhead
